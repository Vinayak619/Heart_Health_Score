# Heart Health Risk Predictor 🫀

A computational model to assess heart health using a graph-based weighted node system.

## 📘 Overview
This model uses multiple physiological, lifestyle, and environmental parameters to compute a "Heart Health Score" between 0–100, indicating the individual’s cardiovascular risk.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Each health parameter is represented as a node with a predefined clinical weight.
- Patient data is normalized and weighted.
- A composite score is computed based on available data, along with a confidence level.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
